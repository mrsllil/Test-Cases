# Test-Cases

Welcome to a collection of example test cases designed for application testing, including both web and mobile platforms.

## Contents

- `MobileAppTestPlan.md` â€“ This file specifically provides a broad outline of test cases for mobile application testing, detailing the main objectives and what each case aims to verify.

## Purpose

The repository showcases samples of how to create an overview of test cases, demonstrating their purpose and scope within application testing. While `MobileAppTestPlan.md` is dedicated to mobile applications, the repository is not limited to them and may include web application test cases in the future.

## Overview

The test cases here are general examples that outline the key aspects of what is being tested, without comprehensive step-by-step instructions or detailed expected outcomes. These examples are suitable for those looking to grasp the basic concepts and structure of test case development for different types of applications.

Feel free to explore and use this repository as a reference for understanding the framework of test case creation for both web and mobile platforms.
